# Makers BnB Challenge

| Reference | Functional Specification | Does current state meet Specifications? | Test Cases | Suggested Enhancements  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MBNB-01 | Any signed-up user can list a new space | Yes, any signed up user can list a new space | List a space by filling in all details on “List a Space” form correctly and check whether this appears in overall list of spaces when search is performed |Apply validation controls to “List a Space” form fields <br>  <br> Indicate mandatory fields <br>  <br> List a space button could be relocated to a less prominent position on the “Book a Space” page to prevent confusion <br>  <br> Rename “List Spaces” button to “Show Available Spaces” |
| MBNB-02 | Users can list multiple spaces | Yes, it is possible to list multiple spaces by repeatedly completing and submitting the “List a Space” form | Add multiple entries by completing “List a Space” form multiple times and check if submissions appear in the “Book a Space page" <br>  <br> Test to ensure there are no duplicated entries by trying to submit identical data on “List a Space” form multiple times with the same criteria, ideally, the form should detect and prevent a duplicate entry from being submitted |Introduce a ‘Bulk Import’ listings feature could permit a text file or csv file to be uploaded with data for space <br>  <br> To make multiple entries simpler could reformat “List a Space” form to show option to add multiple spaces within the same page <br>  <br> A bulk import feature could be more suitable for commercial space owners, would need to consider most appropriate option based on target user |
| MBNB-03 | Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night | Yes, fields exist for user to input: Name, Description and price per night | Add a Name, Description and price-per-night value to “List a Space” form and submit, check if fields are correctly populated<br>  <br>Test invalid inputs in fields e.g. add a string to “price per night” field or add a date in the past to “Available from” field to check if the form accepts these inputs |Enable space owner to add images of the space<br>  <br>Description field could be less generic e.g. introduce categorised fields to specify: location, size/sqft, other included amenities<br>  <br>Show the space owner details of similarly added spaces, perhaps based on location/size/price-per-night criteria to enable competitor/market analysis|
| MBNB-04 | Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available | Yes, able to offer range of dates for a single space through completing multiple submissions of “List a Space” form for consecutive time-frame<br>  <br>More clarity required on range of dates, consecutive period of availability is easy to offer, for intermittent periods functionality is not as simple or easy to implement for a space owner| Complete and submit the “List a Space” form for multiple availability periods that are consecutive e.g. 01.01.22 - 15.03.22; 01.04.22 - 01.07.22 and check space listings to see if they appear as available across multiple periods|Implement a simpler way to indicate intermittent periods of availability<br>  <br>When a space is not available within specified dates do not hide from view, show in list of spaces but display as unavailable|
| MBNB-05 | Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space | Yes, there is a “Request to book” button which should allow the user to request the space for one night, subject to appropriate availability<br>  <br>On submission of request, Space Owner should be able to see user’s request to book the space, once the request is clicked, this should navigate to a page where further details of the request are shown alongside confirm/deny buttons which will issue relevant notifications to each party when clicked by the Space Owner.| Mimic a user making a booking for a single night; check whether the booking request appears in listings of requests for Space Owner<br>  <br>Mimic a user making a booking request for a date that is unavailable, this should not be possible if unavailable dates are greyed out and should not generate a request visible to the Space Owner<br>  <br>Submit multiple bookings for the same space on the same date and test if Space Owner’s acceptance automatically cancels all other requests <br>  <br>Submit multiple bookings for the same space on the same date and test if Space Owner’s rejection does not interfere with status of remaining requests |Enable Space Owners to set up rules to automatically deal with multiple duplicate requests e.g. auto-accept earliest request in event of duplicate requests |
| MBNB-06 | Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space | If we can assume that the confirmation or denial of a request performs an update to availability then the specification is met, this is not specified within the wireframe or other documentation<br>  <br>If confirmation/denial of a request does not also update availability it is a function that has been omitted from considerations and will need to be documented and developed | Make a booking for a space on specific dates (e.g. 12.02.22 - 16.02.22) and confirm this request as a Space Owner then check the following:<br>  <br>Search the spaces listing for a booking of the same space on the requested dates (e.g. 12.02.22 - 16.02.22), the space should not appear in the list of available spaces<br>  <br>Search for the space on alternative dates (e.g. 01.02.22 - 07.02.22) where it is available and check if the calendar greys out dates (12.02.22 - 16.02.22) where previous booking was made <br>  <br>Time a booking request within a few minutes of space owner confirming request for same dates and ensure that user is unable to proceed with booking as no longer available|Enable user to register interest in event of cancellation/re-availability of space on desired dates that are unavailable<br>  <br>Suggest alternative dates to user e.g. next available alternative date or alternative date where a lower price per night is available|
| MBNB-07 | Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night | The specification is only met if we can assume that the confirmation of a request performs an update to availability because this means availability remains unchanged until a request is approved | Submit multiple requests to book for the same space on the same dates and do not confirm any requests, we expect space to still show in “List of spaces” when dates are entered in initial search and also for the available dates to remain live/’clickable’ on the calendar view |Auto approval feature for multiple requestsProvide some indication to the user of interest in the space on the same dates e.g. notification showing “11 users have placed a similar request in the last day” |

## Risks

 - Granting any user the ability to list spaces could lead to ‘fake’/spoof or misleading adverts finding their way into the spaces list, to prevent this there could be some form of authorisation procedure introduced to verify the identity and credibility of a space owner 

 - A single user could make an unreasonable amount of requests/spam requests to a space, implement a limit on the number of requests that can be made for the same space. 

 - A further way to build in additional controls would be to link space owner request confirmation to payment processing, on acceptance of a request a space owner should automatically receive payment for a space. This may require some adjustment to the space booking process to take a deposit amount from the user

 - It is unclear from examining the functional specifications and wireframe whether confirmation or denial of a request performs an update to availability, this feature should be considered, documented and developed to prevent the risk of double bookings occurring 

 - Navigation for users and space owners could be confusing and could be developed further to create an improved flow a suggested enhancement to address this could be the creation of a separate page for Space Owners to manage current listings e.g. ’My Spaces’ page would enable deletion and updates to existing listings, at present this functionality has not been considered.

 - The currently specified notification levels may cause some users concern or inconvenience, perhaps introducing customisation could help e.g. allowing user and space owner to select/de-select events that trigger a notification 

 - Personal information that users and space owners will elect to share when signing up and making requests, this needs to be dealt with appropriately with enough secure controls in place to prevent any unauthorised access

 - Payment Implementation could pose additional risks because more sensitive data is being exchanged, encryption should be used to obscure this data
